Incendium is a datapack that completely revamps the nether, way more than what Minecraft did in the 1.16 Nether Update.

## Notes
- Incendium has an [Optional Resource Pack](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/incendium-optional-resourcepack)! This is __not__ required, but it allows all items to have their own beautiful textures.
- Incendium is **not** compatible with Amplified Nether
- Do not add this to an existing nether - reset yours first, or use a new world
- View the structures and biomes per seed using [jacobsjo](https://github.com/jacobsjo)'s [Minecraft Datapack Map](https://map.jacobsjo.eu/)

## Description
### Biomes
Incendium adds 8 unique biomes to the nether. Do you bravely venture through the perilous **Quartz Flats**, wander the mysterious **Withered Forest**, or battle your way through the steep **Infernal Dunes**? Each biome has a unique personality and story to tell. With unique block themes in each biomes, opportunities for new farms for technical players, 3D biomes, and stunning terrain, there is truly something for everyone.
### Structures
To compliment the lovely biomes, there are 9+ structures for you to explore and conquer. In the Ash Barrens, the **Foribdden Castle** stands forbodingly, with courageous Piglins defending its treasured loot - one of the largest and complex random structures in Minecraft! Alternatively, you can conquer the ominous **Sanctum** with its illagers defending dark secrets and strong weapons. The skeleton chef Torte defends his **Quartz Kitchen**, and the Withered Director his **Nether Reactor**. What will you conquer first?
### Items
Every mob you defeat and structure you conquer has its reward - Incendium pays you handsomely with both rick loot and custom weapons! Defeating the Hovering Inferno could earn you the **Trailblazer** - a flame-spewing bow. A high damage, but taxing **Greatsword of Sacrifice** hides within the Forbidden Castle's walls, along with the helpful **Hefty Pickaxe**. Or maybe you prefer to find the **Hazmat Suit** to protect you from all types of poisonous attacks. There are over 25 items to forge your own playstyle with!
### Mobs
No datapack would be complete without its own mobs to fight you. The Toxic Heap is home of the agile **Toxic Slimes**, and the Withered Forest is haunted by the **Restless Spirits**. On the other hand, you could go on a rescue missue to save the **Ghastling** from the Abandoned Tower - in return, it will defend you from Ghasts. If none of this is challenging, you can summon the all-powerful **Hovering Inferno** boss for a difficult and dirty battle.
